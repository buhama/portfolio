            <h3>A little bit about me</h3>
            <p>A uOttawa Mechanical Engineer, marketing enthusiast, and looking for a company with shared values.</p>
            <p>
                As boring as it sounds, I love tackling fun problems (at the time of writing this I am 
                also trying to solve an alleged “impossible to solve” Sudoku puzzle). The thrill of
                seeing progress and finally reaching a solution is what gets me out of bed every morning. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another boring fact is that I’m a strong believer in “it’s not work if you’re having 
                fun” and I use it as an excuse to devote myself to whatever I’m working on at the 
                moment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What I’m currently doing</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I’m finishing up my last semester at uOttawa and working part-time at the 
                university. Excited to graduate and tackle the real world and all that comes with it. 
                I’ve started some side gigs and am always looking to take on new things that can 
                challenge me. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, I watched the Queen’s Gambit on Netflix and am now playing Chess every day. 
                Turns out I’m not a chess prodigy and I’m very disappointed to learn this. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Fun Facts?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                I love excel, unironically. <br>
                I can’t swim but also have escaped drowning on multiple occasions. <br>
                My dream is to one day retire and go skydiving as much as I can until eventually….

            <p>
                I respond to emails at lightning speed so you can contact me at hassan@hassanahmed.ca 
                (it costs me $40/year to have this domain since I have such a common name, so any use
                out of it would be wonderful). 
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also find me on LinkedIn. I’m a lot less fun there though.
