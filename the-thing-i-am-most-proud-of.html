                What is Campus Vibez uOttawa (also known as CVUO)? Itâ€™s reallyyyy hard to explain. 
                When it comes down to it, it is a brand new administrative/marketing service for all 
                student clubs and associations at the University of Ottawa. It originally started off
                as a student club but has grown to be so much more and is hands down the highlight of
                my professional career.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bringing up this organization from the ground up and seeing massive growth year after 
                year has been a thrilling experience. I have learned everything I know about working 
                on a team, leadership, time management, and an ongoing list of skills all from working 
                at CVUO. I say with confidence that my team and I, in a very short amount of time, have 
                changed the student life at uOttawa.
