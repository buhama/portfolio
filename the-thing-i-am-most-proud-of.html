                What is Campus Vibez uOttawa (also known as CVUO)? It’s reallyyyy hard to explain. 
                When it comes down to it, it is a brand new administrative and marketing service for all 
                student clubs and associations at the University of Ottawa. It originally started off
                as a student club but has grown to be so much more and is hands down the highlight of
                my professional career.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bringing up this organization from the ground up and seeing massive growth year after 
                year has been a thrilling experience. I have learned everything I know about working 
                on a team, leadership, time management, and an ongoing list of skills all from working 
                at CVUO. I say with confidence that my team and I, in a very short amount of time, have 
                changed the student life at uOttawa. 
            </p>
            <h3>A brief story</h3>
            <p>
                Initially, CVUO was meant to be a club that was providing marketing services to other 
                uOttawa student organizations for a price. After a few years of little to no success, 
                we finally started picking up pace in 2018-2019 (my second year running the team). 
                After what was a crazy 8 months of unprecedented success, we reached out to the 
                University of Ottawa Student Union to collaborate on more projects. What initially
                started as small talks about things we could work on together soon ended up with 
                CVUO taking over the entire club system at uOttawa by the start of the 2019 Fall 
                Semester. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For our very first year as a service to clubs, we were given a small budget and a 
                team comprised entirely of volunteers and yet were the most efficient and effective 
                service at the university. Completely changing the relationship between student groups 
                and the student union within a year. But of course, things didn’t stop there, currently,
                are in our second year as a service and have 3 paid employees, a budget that has increased 
                by 40x what it was in 2018, and have added countless new services that we provide to clubs. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As one of the most known services and student groups on campus, the entire team takes
                pride in what we accomplish and our results speak for themselves. 
            </p>
            <h3>Things we have accomplished</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, we are providing our services to the <strong>highest number of student clubs</strong> in
                uOttawa’s 172 years as an institution, with over 360 active student groups on campus, of course 
                despite the negative effect on student life by COVID. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In September 2020, we launched a brand new funding system for student groups, with $200,000
                budgeted to be given out for student activities. This also being an unprecedented and 
                highest number in uOttawa’s history for student clubs. In September we were able to 
                fund over 90 different groups and are gearing up to repeat the process in January 2021. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For the first time in a while, student groups will also be given storage space on 
                campus due to our efforts with the university and the student union. 
            </p>
            <p>Last year we introduced the first edition of the Student Life Awards. An award show 
                recognizing the hard work that university students put into their extracurriculars. 
                With nearly <strong>50 different groups nominated</strong> and <strong>23 different awards</strong> 
                to be won, it was one of the most diverse and largest student-run events 
                at the university. We will be hosting the second edition of the event in March 2021. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As one of the most well-known organizations on campus, we have also had the opportunity 
                to establish a long-term partnership with the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) to set up a 
                system for clubs to make bank accounts with the bank. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At CVUO, I strongly believe our success can be contributed to our efforts in always 
                improving the services we are providing, and as such every day we are coming up with
                new ideas on how we can continue to improve the student life on campus. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                The Team
            </h3>
            <p>
                Being a team still comprised majorly of student volunteers it is still shocking to 
                any onlookers all that we are able to accomplish. Of course, I couldn’t mention all
                 our accomplishments without listing every single person that has helped in making 
                 those things possible. I consider myself extremely lucky to be surrounded by so many 
                 talented people, with whom I have been blessed to create long-lasting friendships.
